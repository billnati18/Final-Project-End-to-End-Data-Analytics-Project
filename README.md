# Project Description:Enhancing Urban Happiness through Data-Driven Insights

### Project Context:

This data analytics project dives into factors that impact urban happiness, like traffic density, green spaces, air quality, cost of living, healthcare, and more. By analyzing a diverse dataset from cities worldwide, we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that can guide city planners and policymakers in making informed decisions. From understanding how traffic affects stress levels to exploring the link between green spaces and happiness, our goal is to provide actionable insights to create happier, healthier, and more livable cities.

### Overview of the Analysis:

The analysis involves a comprehensive exploration of a dataset curated by Emirhan BULUT from Kaggle, encompassing diverse features from cities worldwide. The dataset captures key aspects such as traffic density, green space percentage, air quality index, healthcare quality, cost of living, and auditory comfort, culminating in the happiness score of each city on a 1-10 scale.

### Selected Hypotheses:

- Traffic Density Impact on Happiness:

    1. Analysis of happiness scores across cities with varying traffic density levels.
        Statistical tests to identify significant differences.
        Insights and recommendations for mitigating traffic-related stress.
        
        Hypotheses:
        H0: No significant difference in happiness scores between cities with different traffic density levels.
        H1: Cities with lower traffic density levels exhibit higher average happiness scores.

    2. Green Space and Happiness:
        Exploration of the relationship between green space percentage and happiness scores.
        Assessment of whether higher green space correlates with increased happiness.
        Recommendations for urban planning strategies to enhance green spaces.

        Hypotheses:
        H0: The percentage of green space in a city does not significantly affect the happiness score.
        H1: Cities with a higher percentage of green space have higher average happiness scores.

    3. Air Quality and Well-being:

        Investigation into the correlation between air quality index and happiness scores.
        Evaluation of whether improved air quality contributes to higher happiness.
        Proposals for measures to enhance air quality in cities.

        Hypotheses:
        H0: No correlation between the air quality index and happiness score in cities.
        H1: Cities with better air quality exhibit higher average happiness scores.

### Data Tools Used:

The analysis utilizes a range of data tools for processing, exploration, and visualization. Commonly employed tools include Python programming language, along with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and SciPy for statistical tests.

### Project Goal:

My aim is to figure out what makes people in cities happy. By looking at data from various places worldwide, I want to understand how factors like traffic, green spaces, air quality, and others affect happiness. The goal is to help city planners make better decisions, so they can create cities where people feel happier and more satisfied with their lives.

# Project Setup and Analysis Steps

Follow these steps to set up and conduct the analysis for the City Happiness Index - 2024 dataset:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using:"pip install -r requirements.txt"

Step 3: Load the dataset

Load the test.csv file into your preferred data analysis environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script) or download directly from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/city-happiness-index-2024?rvi=1) 

Step 4: Explore Data

Explore the datasets to gain a preliminary understanding. Check for missing values, outliers, and any patterns that may influence the analysis.

Step 5: Preprocess Data

Preprocess the data as needed. Handle missing values, perform data cleaning, and ensure datasets are in a suitable format for analysis.

Step 6: Conduct A/B Testing Analysis

Utilize statistical techniques to analyze the A/B test results. 

Step 7: Visualize Results

Step 10: Contribute or Share Results

If applicable, contribute your findings back to the project repository. Share results with relevant stakeholders, and consider how your analysis might inform future iterations of the digital experiment.

# Key Findings

1. Traffic Density Impact on Happiness: 
    In examining the relationship between traffic density and happiness scores, our analysis reveals that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is no significant difference in happiness scores among cities with varying levels of traffic density. Contrary to the alternative hypothesis, cities with lower traffic density do not exhibit consistently higher average happiness scores compared to those with higher traffic density. This suggests that, based on our data, traffic density alone may not be a decisive factor influencing overall happiness in urban environments. Further nuances and contributing factors may need exploration to better understand the complex dynamics between traffic density and the well-being of city residents.

2. Green Space and Happiness:
    In investigating the connection between green space percentage and happiness scores, our analysis leads us to reject the null hypothesis. The data suggests a significant correlation between the percentage of green space in a city and its happiness scores. Cities with a higher proportion of green spaces tend to have higher average happiness scores. This finding underscores the positive impact of green spaces on the well-being of urban populations. It implies that urban planning strategies aimed at increasing green spaces could contribute to fostering higher levels of happiness among city residents. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating and preserving green areas within the urban landscape to enhance overall city happiness.

3.  Air Quality and Well-being:   
    Our analysis rejects the null hypothesis, revealing a significant correlation between air quality index and happiness scores in cities. Cities with better air quality tend to boast higher average happiness scores. This highlights the critical role of clean air in enhancing the overall well-being and contentment of urban residents. Policy and initiatives aimed at improving air quality could be key to fostering higher levels of happiness in urban environments.

# Conclusion

The examination of these factors highlights the intricate relationship between urban characteristics and residents' well-being. While traffic density did not show a clear connection with happiness, the presence of green spaces and better air quality emerged as significant contributors to elevated happiness scores. Policymakers and urban planners are encouraged to prioritize the integration of green spaces and measures to improve air quality to create thriving and content urban environments.
